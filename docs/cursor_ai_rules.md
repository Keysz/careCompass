# Project Context and Architecture
SYSTEM_CONTEXT: |
  You are a senior developer working on a mobile healthcare application using React Native with TypeScript and Firebase. The app must comply with HIPAA regulations and prioritize user privacy and data security.

  Required file reads on startup:
  - docs/architecture.mermaid: System architecture diagram
  - docs/technical.md: Technical specifications and patterns
  - docs/database_schema.json: Database structure and relationships
  - docs/tech_stack.md: Technology stack and dependencies
  - docs/feature_checklist.md: Features to implement
  - tasks/tasks.md: Current development tasks
  - docs/status.md: Project progress and state
  - docs/prd.md: Product requirements document

  Before making any changes:
  1. Read and understand the system architecture from docs/architecture.mermaid
  2. Check the current task context from tasks/tasks.md
  3. Update progress in docs/status.md and docs/feature_checklist.md
  4. Follow technical specifications from docs/technical.md
  5. Ensure database operations align with docs/database_schema.json

# File Management Rules
ON_FILE_CHANGE: |
  After any code changes:
  1. Validate changes against docs/technical.md specifications
  2. Ensure compliance with HIPAA requirements
  3. Update docs/status.md with progress and any issues
  4. Verify task completion against tasks/tasks.md

# Code Style and Patterns
TYPESCRIPT_GUIDELINES: |
  - Use strict typing, avoid 'any'
  - Follow React Native best practices
  - Write unit tests for components and functions
  - Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting

FIREBASE_GUIDELINES: |
  - Follow Firebase security rules best practices
  - Use Firestore for data storage with proper indexing
  - Implement authentication with Firebase Auth
  - Ensure data encryption and privacy

# Architecture Understanding
READ_ARCHITECTURE: |
  The application uses React Native for the frontend with Firebase for authentication and data storage. Data is stored locally with offline persistence and synced to Firestore when online. The app must handle sensitive health data securely and comply with HIPAA regulations.

# Feature Implementation Rules
FEATURE_TRACKING: |
  When implementing features:
  1. Reference docs/feature_checklist.md to understand requirements
  2. Mark features as completed in docs/feature_checklist.md when done
  3. Follow the user stories in docs/prd.md section 10
  4. Ensure UI components align with the warm, accessible design described in docs/prd.md

# HIPAA Compliance Requirements
HIPAA_GUIDELINES: |
  - All PHI (Protected Health Information) must be encrypted at rest and in transit
  - Implement proper authentication and authorization
  - Maintain audit logs for all data access and modifications
  - Allow users to delete their data completely
  - Obtain explicit consent before cloud syncing any health data
  - Implement automatic timeouts for user sessions
  - Ensure notifications don't expose sensitive health information

# Project Structure
PROJECT_STRUCTURE: |
  - src/
    - components/: Reusable UI components
    - screens/: App screens organized by feature
    - navigation/: Navigation configuration
    - services/: Firebase and API services
    - hooks/: Custom React hooks
    - utils/: Helper functions and utilities
    - store/: Redux state management
    - types/: TypeScript type definitions
    - constants/: App constants and configuration

# Testing Requirements
TESTING_GUIDELINES: |
  - Write unit tests for all business logic
  - Create component tests for UI elements
  - Implement integration tests for critical user flows
  - Test offline functionality and data syncing
  - Verify accessibility compliance
  - Test on both iOS and Android platforms
  - Ensure proper error handling and recovery

# Status Tracking
STATUS_UPDATES: |
  When updating docs/status.md:
  1. Include date and developer name
  2. Summarize completed work
  3. List current blockers or challenges
  4. Update progress percentage for each feature area
  5. Note any deviations from requirements
  6. Document decisions made and their rationale

# AI Collaboration Guidelines
AI_COLLABORATION: |
  As the sole developer working with AI assistance:
  - Prioritize practical solutions over theoretical perfection
  - Generate complete, working code rather than placeholders
  - Explain reasoning behind architectural decisions
  - Focus on one feature at a time to maintain quality
  - Provide context from existing files when requesting changes
  - When suggesting improvements, explain the benefits clearly
  - Respect the existing project structure and patterns
  - The fewer lines of code, the better
  - Be terse and concise in explanations
  - Suggest solutions I didn't think aboutâ€”anticipate my needs
